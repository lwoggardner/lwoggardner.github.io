## Dead Projects

* [GGAuth](http:/https://www.dokuwiki.org/auth:ggauth)

   A set of auth backends for Dokuwiki

* [OpenJaWS](http://openjaws.googlecode.com/)

    Java WeatherStation with support for Lacross WS23xx series

* [JEN](http://jen.sourceforge.net/)

    Container independent web utilities for Java (in particular FastCGI)

* [JIM](http://jim.sourceforge.net/)

    Java Image Manager. Before things like F-Spot and Shotwell, might still be useful
    if someone wants to see lossless jpeg rotation or exif parsing in Java.
